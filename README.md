# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles
in Python.

I'm a Python n00b as well as a novice programmer so if you see this please make
a pull request / file an issue if you see anything that can be improved
(especially variable names I sure am bad at those) so I can learn from my
mistakes!
